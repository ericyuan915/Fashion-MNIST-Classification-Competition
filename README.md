# Fashion-MNIST-Classification-Competition

The dataset, named as “train.zip” can be downloaded from the Resource page in Piazza. After decompressing the .zip file, there exist 10 folders named from “0” to “9”. Each training and testing image is assigned to one of the following labels, and each folder contains all the training examples for the corresponding label.

Each (28 pixels*28 pixels) image can be viewed as a 28*28 2-dimensional matrix, where each element in this matrix is an integer within 0~255.

The task is to implement a machine learning algorithm that predicts the labels, given the image data, with any machine learning model.
